- Added correct calculation of time axis for multi-integration
  data in different observing modes. Note that this will not
  really know how to handle processed data since that is handled
  on an individual integration basis.  So this will make taking
  a quick look at raw images multi-int images useful but doesn't
  expand the functionality to multi-integration processed images. 
- Bumped revision to 36.  

Fri Jun 06 2014 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Restored access to .wfs, .hdr, .cds images.  Don't know 
  why I disabled it; probably had a reason and all hell 
  will break loose now, but what the hay. 
- Cleaned up some debugging output. All of it? I'm not sure.
- Really fixed the pixel coordinates in motion on image. 
  Really. 
- Bumped revision to 35. 

Wed Jul 03 2013 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Fixed clean up of various images on load of new image. 
  For example, if you loaded an image with a slope and 
  subsequently loaded an image without a slope, the previous
  slope image would remain in memory as the slope. Oops. 
- Fixed pixel coordinates in motion on image. Previously,
  the STATE variable for coordinates was updated during 
  motion events on the image, resulting in update of any
  plotted ramps in the PIXHISTORY widget on the next action
  in that widget.  Now STATE coordinates only get updated
  on button events in the image window.
- Bumped revision to 34

Thu Aug 23 2012 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Fixed BUFFERED mode (large files read off disk as needed
  rather than stored in RAM). 
- Added 'Read Buffered' to pull down file menu.
- Bumped revision to 33

Wed May 30 2012 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Fixed broken slope image load. 
- Fixed scaling min/max 
- Bumped revision to 32

Tue May 15 2012 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added WFS functionality back in.  Oops. 
- Refined time calculation
- Bumped revision to 31

Sat Mar 03 2012 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- fixed min/max generation when scaling image.
- Plot difference rather than ratio in pixel history
- Still need to fix the current pixel...
- the modularity actually didn't get commited... bumping to 30

Wed Oct 12 2011 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added modularity in object definitions for various image
  types. 
- Added functionality to PixelHistory window. 
- Small bug fixes. 
- Identified origin of bug regarding current pixel - not 
  fixed here, but in the pipeline. 
- Bumped revision to 27

Mon Oct 25 2010 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Fixed wrap around issues on browse buttons. 
- Added a slider for perusing frames
- Bumped revision to 26

Thu Oct 21 2010 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added scaling options. 
- Bumped revision to 25

Mon Jul 26 2010 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Moved object definition to new file/object name.  
  This was just for compatibility with some other definitions
  I use in other code - need to clean up my NIRCam IDL 
  libraries...
- Added an SCA identifier field.  Look for keyword 'PARTNAME' 
  and puts that in a widget_label on front panel.  
- Added minimal keyword retrieval function to the data object. 
- Bumped revision to 24

* Tue Jun 05 2010 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added ratio option to pixel history.  If a ramp has been
  fit, clicking the 'ratio' button on the history window
  will plot the ratio of the data to the fit. 
  Coding completed last month, just letting bugs shake out. 

* Fri Mar 26 2010 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu> 
- Modified output parsing.  This version of NCView is NOT
  compatible with version of ncdhas prior to v2.0.  ie. it
  will only be compatible with ncdhas output from SVN 
  revisions >= 73. 

* Mon Jan 18 2009 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added header viewer. No telemetry plotting or searching yet. 
- Tagged for "stable" release. Plans to modify the DHAS code 
   output format mean that back ward compatibility will not 
   be possible. 

* Thu May 7 2009 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Assume indexing of saturation frame is 1 indexed. 
  Fixes issues with plotting when no saturation was detected. 
- Cleaned up diagnostic print/help statements.
- Bumped svn revision to 19

* Wed May 6 2009 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Correctly parse saturated range info from dhas info to 
  overplot range used in fit on pixel histories. 

* Tue May 5 2009 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Improved auto scaling for slope image. 

* Tue Apr 21 2009 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Cleaned up panner window
- Added zoom functionality to the pixel history window.

* Mon Mar 9 2009   Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Cleaned up time axis calculation for LMATC data, taking 
  into account value of DROMFRM1

* Fri Feb 6 2009  Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Made time axis computation consistent with DHAS/Accumulator. 
  Version bump to 14

* Fri Aug 15 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu> 
- Forgot to bump subversion revision in Version string. 
  So from 12->13, only updated version string...

* Fri Aug 15 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu> 
- Changed main program name to have same name as calling sequence
  so that, if the NCView tree is in your IDL path, just typing
  ncview will work (ie. no .r NCView)
- Added options to visualize Raw, Processed, or Slope fit images. 
- Added file dump to pixel history.
- Added slope/intercept reports on pixel history window. 
- Modified file chooser so that it will remember the last location
  from which you loaded an image. 
- Added 'path' keyword so that you can specify the initial search 
  path in startup, eg. > ncview,path='/home/misselt' will start
  file chooser dialog in /home/misselt
- Bumped version to 0.9 (on subversion revision 12)

* Wed Jul 16 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Can specify pixel to plot in the pixel history window. 
  Specifying a new pixel in the history window will update the display
  and panner as well.

* XXX Jun xx 2008  Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Modified to check for SUBARRMD keyword so that the time axis can 
  be properly computed. 

* Wed Apr 23 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu> 
- If .slp.fits image exists, the fitted slope will be overplotted in 
  Pixel History. 

* Thu Apr 17 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Time axis is properly computed for pixel history display. 

* Mon Apr 14 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Center is now functional. 
- Invert is now functional. 

* Fri Apr 11 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added panner functionality. 
- Added plot window colortables. 

* Thu Mar 13 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Added current pixel info (x,y) to PixelHistory window. 

* Mon Mar 05 2008 Karl Misselt <misselt@as.arizona.edu>
- Fixed pixel history plot to refer to real image values rather than 
  regrided display image.  
- Added event handlers for manually scaling display in pixel history window.
- Modified pixel history behavior; when "Mouse Ctl" set to "Pixel History",
  all button clicks will draw the history of the current pixel. When other
  "Mouse Ctl" modes are selected, middle mouse button will still produce 
  "Pixel History" events. 
  o Color 
    Left button = scale color table
    Mid button = plot current pixel history
    Right button = scale color table
  o Zoom 
    Left button = zoom in
    Mid button = plot current pixel history
    Right button = zoom out
  o Pixel History 
    All buttons plot current pixel history
