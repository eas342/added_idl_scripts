* Implement ramp subsection - ie. don't read in full ramp, rather
  a section based on available RAM and read in next block when user
  requests it.  
  This will require having GetPixel do a fits_read operation. 

* Get Different color tables working. 
  - Same color table for PixelHistory?  OR Maintain different color tabels? 

* Need to separate ncview from other possible user idl sessions.  Don't 
  know exactly how to do this...

* Add front end for DHAS execution. 
  - Configure via gui. 
  - Save configuration as a .cfg file for batch processing. 
  - kick off DHAS execution
  - update visualization with new, processed data. 
  NOTE:  NCDHAS_Execute is a skeleton of how to maybe approach 
         this.  Needs lots of work though (in fact it doesn't really
         do anything right now...).
