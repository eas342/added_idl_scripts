# Useful IDL Scripts - Schlawin
My collection of useful IDL scripts. Both my personal ones as well as other scripts available online.

Add to your IDL path. My preferred method to do this is by editing my `.bash_profile` file:

	export IDL_PATH=$IDL_PATH:+/path/added_scripts
where `/path` is the path to this directory.
